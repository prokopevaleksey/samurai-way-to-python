# SAMURAI WAY TO PYTHON

*Beautiful is better than ugly.*

*Explicit is better than implicit.*

*Simple is better than complex.*

*Complex is better than complicated.*

*Flat is better than nested.*

*Sparse is better than dense.*

*Readability counts.*

*Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.*

*Although practicality beats purity.*

*Errors should never pass silently.*

*Unless explicitly silenced.*

*In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.*

*There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.*

*Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.*

*Now is better than never.*

*Although never is often better than right now.*

*If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.*

*If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.*

*Namespaces are one honking great idea—let's do more of those!*

# GET STARTED

> conda create -n <ENVIROMENT_NAME>

 - activate the environment 
> activate <ENVIROMENT_NAME>

- install jupyter notebook
> conda install ipython notebook
 
- set up the notebook
> python -m ipykernel install --user --name ENVNAME --display-name "<ENVIROMENT_NAME>"

- launch notebook

It should open a browser page with the jupyter interface.
